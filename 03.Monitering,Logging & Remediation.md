# 1.Amazon Cloutwatch Overview

### Summary: Amazon CloudWatch Overview

Amazon CloudWatch is a performance monitoring service designed to monitor AWS resources and on-premises systems. It provides alarms, log collection, and automated actions, helping to improve operational performance and resource optimization.

#### Core Features of CloudWatch:

1. **CloudWatch Metrics**:
   - AWS services send time-ordered data points to CloudWatch.
   - EC2 instances send metrics every five minutes by default (standard monitoring) and every one minute with detailed monitoring (for a small fee).
   - The CloudWatch agent sends system-level metrics, such as memory and disk usage, which are not included in standard EC2 metrics.

2. **CloudWatch Alarms**:
   - Monitors metrics and initiates actions when thresholds are reached.
   - Two types: Metric Alarms (based on a single metric) and Composite Alarms (based on multiple alarms).
   - Alarm states include OK, Alarm, and Insufficient Data.

3. **CloudWatch Logs**:
   - Centralized collection of system and application logs from AWS resources and on-premises systems.
   - Useful for operational visibility and insights.

4. **CloudWatch Events**:
   - Triggers actions based on system events describing changes to resources.
   - Largely replaced by Amazon EventBridge for event handling.

#### Key Use Cases and Benefits:
- Collects performance metrics and logs from AWS and on-premises systems.
- Automates responses to operational changes, such as auto-scaling EC2 instances based on CPU utilization.
- Improves resource optimization by providing actionable insights from logs and metrics.
- Helps in maintaining operational performance within acceptable parameters.

#### Custom Metrics and Alarms:
- Custom metrics can be published to CloudWatch using the CLI or API with standard (one minute) or high resolution (one second) granularity.
- Alarms can trigger automated actions, such as launching new EC2 instances when resource utilization exceeds a certain threshold.

By using CloudWatch, users can effectively monitor and manage their AWS resources, ensuring optimal performance and resource utilization.

# 2.Metrics,Namespaces & Dimensions

### Summary: CloudWatch Metrics, Namespaces, and Dimensions

#### CloudWatch Metrics
- **Fundamental Concept**: Metrics represent time-ordered sets of data points sent from AWS resources or custom sources to CloudWatch.
- **Characteristics**:
  - Metrics exist within a region and can't be deleted, expiring automatically after 15 months.
  - Defined by a unique name, namespace, and zero or more dimensions.
  - Time stamps can be up to two weeks in the past or two hours in the future.
- **Retention**:
  - High-resolution custom metrics (period < 60 seconds): Available for 3 hours.
  - Metrics with a 60-second period: Available for 15 days.
  - Metrics with a 300-second period: Available for 63 days.
  - Metrics with a 3600-second period: Available for 455 days (15 months).

#### Namespaces
- **Definition**: A container for CloudWatch metrics specific to a service, isolating them from metrics in other namespaces.
- **Example**: Amazon API Gateway metrics are in the namespace `AWS/API Gateway`.
- **Custom Namespaces**: Users can create custom namespaces for their metrics.

#### Dimensions
- **Definition**: Name-value pairs that define the identity of a metric.
- **Usage**: Up to 10 dimensions can be assigned to a metric.
- **Categories**: Metrics are categorized by dimensions, such as EC2 instance metrics by auto-scaling group or per instance.

#### Statistics
- **Definition**: Metric data aggregations over specified periods.
- **Types**: Include minimum, maximum, sum, average, and sample count.
- **Purpose**: Provide insights into resource utilization.

#### Useful API Actions
- **GetMetricData**: Retrieves metric data for up to 500 metrics in a single request.
- **PutMetricData**: Publishes metric data points to CloudWatch, creating metrics if they don't exist.
- **GetMetricStatistics**: Retrieves statistics for specified metrics, aggregating data points based on the specified period.

By understanding metrics, namespaces, and dimensions, users can effectively utilize CloudWatch for detailed monitoring and management of their AWS resources.

# 3.Create a Custom Metric and Alarm:Hands_ON
### Summary

This lesson focuses on working with Amazon CloudWatch to create a custom metric and an alarm based on that metric. Here's a breakdown of the key points covered:

1. **CloudWatch Console Overview**:
   - Explored various sections of the CloudWatch console including dashboards, alarms, logs, metrics, X-Ray traces, events, application monitoring, and insights.

3. **Custom Metric Creation**:
   - Explained the creation of a custom metric using the `put-metric-data` API.
   - Introduced CloudWatch Agent for metric collection, to be covered in a later lesson.

4. **CloudWatch Features**:
   - Briefly mentioned Explorer for tag-based views and streams using Kinesis Data Firehose.
   - Covered the use of logs and their integration with applications like Nginx.
   - Events are now managed through Amazon EventBridge.

5. **Setting Up IAM Role and Policy**:
   - Created an IAM role and instance profile with a policy to allow the `put-metric-data` API.
   - Used AWS CloudShell to execute the necessary commands to create and attach policies and roles.

6. **Launching an EC2 Instance**:
   - Created a security group and launched an EC2 instance with the created role and security group.
   - Connected to the instance using EC2 Instance Connect to run further commands.

7. **Creating and Running a Custom Metric Script**:
   - Installed the `stress` utility on the EC2 instance.
   - Created a shell script to send custom metric data to CloudWatch.
   - Used `cron` to schedule the script to run every minute.

8. **Generating Load and Viewing Metrics**:
   - Generated CPU load using the `stress` utility to see custom metrics in CloudWatch.
   - Confirmed the custom metrics appeared in the CloudWatch console.

9. **Creating an Alarm**:
   - Created an alarm in CloudWatch for the custom metric.
   - Configured the alarm to send notifications via SNS (Simple Notification Service).
   - Waited for the alarm to trigger based on the defined threshold and received an email notification.

10. **Cleanup**:
   - Recommended terminating the EC2 instance and optionally cleaning up the created IAM role, policy, and security group.

This lesson provided hands-on experience with CloudWatch, including the creation and monitoring of custom metrics and setting up alarms using the AWS CLI and CloudShell.
