# 1.AWS Cloud Formation

In this video, the instructor explains AWS CloudFormation, a tool for defining and provisioning infrastructure and applications on AWS using code (JSON or YAML). CloudFormation allows you to create infrastructure consistently and with fewer errors by defining it in template files. These templates can include complex setups like VPCs with subnets, auto-scaling groups, EC2 instances, and load balancers. 
![image](https://github.com/Mohanakri/AWS_SOA-Admin/assets/96922237/efbf16cd-e46e-4264-ade6-95b6b9f0cf8c)

Key benefits of CloudFormation include:
- Consistent infrastructure provisioning with fewer human errors.
- Time and effort savings compared to manual configuration.
- Ability to use version control and peer review for templates.
- Free to use, with charges only for the resources provisioned.
- Management of updates, dependencies, rollbacks, and stack deletions.
![image](https://github.com/Mohanakri/AWS_SOA-Admin/assets/96922237/781de20e-f9d4-4d44-a746-1a9a6e9edd79)

Important components of CloudFormation:
1. **Template File:** Text files in JSON or YAML defining the AWS environment to build.
2. **Stack:** The environment built from a template, managed as a single unit.
3. **Stack Set:** Allows creation, update, and deletion of stacks across multiple accounts and regions.
4. **Change Sets:** Preview changes to an existing stack before implementing them.

The instructor mentions that further details will be covered in subsequent lessons.
==========================================================================================
# 2.Deploy Stacks & Change Sets:Hands_ON

In this lesson, the focus is on deploying AWS CloudFormation stacks and change sets using provided YAML files. The lesson covers the following steps:

1. **Introduction to CloudFormation Templates**:
   - Start with a simple template (File 1) that specifies an AWS EC2 instance.
   - Upload the template to create a stack in the CloudFormation console, which uses admin permissions by default.
   - Verify the creation of the EC2 instance in the AWS EC2 console.

2. **Adding an Elastic IP (EIP)**:
   - Use File 2, which includes an EC2 instance and an EIP resource.
   - Demonstrate how to update an existing stack using a change set, adding the EIP to the instance.

3. **Mapping Feature**:
   - Introduce mappings (File 3) to select resources based on criteria like environment (DEV/PROD) and region (US East 1/US West 1).
   - Deploy stacks in different regions to show how mappings affect resource configurations.

4. **Using Parameters**:
   - Incorporate parameters (File 4) to allow specifying the environment (DEV/PROD) during stack creation.
   - Show how parameters dynamically select instance types based on the chosen environment.

5. **Security Groups and User Data**:
   - Add security groups (File 5) to allow specific inbound traffic.
   - Skip to a more complex template (File 6) that includes user data to install an Apache web server on the EC2 instance.
   - Deploy the stack and verify the web server setup by accessing the instance's public IP.

6. **Resource Management**:
   - Explain how to delete stacks and manage resources like Elastic IPs to avoid unnecessary costs.

Throughout the lesson, the instructor emphasizes verifying the correct deployment and configuration of resources in the AWS console and using logical and physical IDs to manage and reference resources within CloudFormation templates. The lesson concludes with a cleanup of resources and a preview of more complex stacks in the next session.
==========================================================================================
# 3.Stack,Stack Sets & Nested Stacks

The lesson focuses on understanding CloudFormation Stacks, Stack Sets, and Nested Stacks in AWS:
![image](https://github.com/Mohanakri/AWS_SOA-Admin/assets/96922237/2ea532ab-dbad-4431-a0c7-d3207aa40bc9)
1. **CloudFormation Stacks**:
   - Resources deployed based on CloudFormation templates.
   - Managed through the AWS Management Console, CLI, or APIs.
   - Automatic rollback on error is enabled by default to terminate or delete resources if an issue occurs during creation.
   - Charges apply for any used resources, even if there's an error.

![image](https://github.com/Mohanakri/AWS_SOA-Admin/assets/96922237/e8e5135a-6a22-4937-880c-1d35b4557960)

2. **Stack Sets**:
   - Enable the creation, update, or deletion of stacks across multiple accounts and regions with a single operation.
   - Managed through an administrator account in which the stack set is created.
   - The target account is where the stacks are deployed or managed.

![image](https://github.com/Mohanakri/AWS_SOA-Admin/assets/96922237/9aafab33-fce7-4ab5-abf1-4f47d5c1bc6a)

3. **Nested Stacks**:
   - Allow reuse of CloudFormation code for common use cases, like configurations for load balancers, web servers, application servers, or VPCs.
   - Standard templates are created for each use case and referenced within the main CloudFormation template.
   - Hierarchical structure where a root stack can call various nested stacks, which may call additional nested stacks, promoting standardization and reuse.

A diagram was referenced, showing a root stack with various nested stacks, demonstrating the hierarchical and reusable nature of nested stacks in CloudFormation.
=========================================================================================
# 4.Cloud Formation Template Deep Dive

This lesson delves into the components of a CloudFormation template, which are YAML or JSON-based templates used to describe the infrastructure to be created with CloudFormation. The templates can be uploaded directly to CloudFormation or to S3, from where CloudFormation will read and make API calls to provision the infrastructure.

Key components covered:

![image](https://github.com/Mohanakri/AWS_SOA-Admin/assets/96922237/922ca9f3-2f27-434a-9ea6-2ace3ac34012)

2. **Intrinsic Functions**:
   - **Ref**: Returns the value of a specified parameter or resource.
   - **Fn::GetAtt**: Returns the value of an attribute from a resource in the template.
   - **FindInMap**: Returns the value corresponding to keys in a two-level map declared in the mapping section.

3. **Sections of a Template**:
![image](https://github.com/Mohanakri/AWS_SOA-Admin/assets/96922237/11f373e4-ed1f-4bb6-9bd8-60d3b3fd9c0b)

   - **Resources**: Mandatory section declaring the AWS resources to include in the stack.

![image](https://github.com/Mohanakri/AWS_SOA-Admin/assets/96922237/69d06d98-b594-49cf-ba7a-b0f23c411b94)

   - **Parameters**: Optional section allowing customization and reuse of templates.

![image](https://github.com/Mohanakri/AWS_SOA-Admin/assets/96922237/e6da05bd-a831-47cf-9fdb-cb44db525ddf)

   - **Mappings**: Optional section matching keys to corresponding named values, useful for setting values based on the region.

![image](https://github.com/Mohanakri/AWS_SOA-Admin/assets/96922237/7007024d-84f2-41d9-ab07-a88c7276ba34)

   - **Outputs**: Optional section for declaring output values that can be imported to other stacks or viewed in the console.

![image](https://github.com/Mohanakri/AWS_SOA-Admin/assets/96922237/1324e1a6-2a6c-4bdb-afa1-88a1781a7d88)

   - **Conditions**: Optional section defining circumstances under which entities are created or configured.

   - **Transforms**: Optional section specifying macros for processing the template, including AWS SAM (Serverless Application Model) and AWS Include for template snippets stored separately.

Examples were provided to illustrate the use of these components, emphasizing their utility and importance, especially for exams. The lesson concluded with a look at how the AWS serverless transform can simplify defining a Lambda function and referencing its code stored in S3.

=========================================================================================
# 5.Cloud formation Helper Scripts(cfn-init & cfn-signal)

This lesson covers two CloudFormation helper scripts, `cfn-init` and `cfn-signal`, which assist in installing software and starting services on Amazon EC2 instances within a CloudFormation stack.

![image](https://github.com/Mohanakri/AWS_SOA-Admin/assets/96922237/be70fb33-f0b7-4e33-9c97-5c0cfc3be3d0)

![image](https://github.com/Mohanakri/AWS_SOA-Admin/assets/96922237/8d2fb3cd-09f0-4d69-878b-e47c84237430)

### cfn-init:
- **Function**: Reads template metadata from the AWS CloudFormation init key to perform actions such as fetching and parsing metadata, installing packages, writing files to disk, and managing services (start, stop, enable, disable).
- **Logging**: Logs are stored at `/var/log/cfn-init.log`.
- **Usage**: The `UserData` and `Metadata` properties in a template can reference `cfn-init` to install files and packages.

![image](https://github.com/Mohanakri/AWS_SOA-Admin/assets/96922237/f2520e63-7d60-44f6-a86d-cd59e9cb2f3f)

![image](https://github.com/Mohanakri/AWS_SOA-Admin/assets/96922237/0e0f8009-f9c4-444c-abcb-aba6764f0e1f)

### cfn-signal:
- **Function**: Signals CloudFormation whether instances have been successfully created or updated.
- **Usage**: Used in conjunction with a creation policy or an auto-scaling group with a wait condition to ensure applications are ready before going into production.
- **Example**: A template runs `cfn-signal` in the `UserData` property, sending a success signal with an exit code if the services are successfully configured and started.

![image](https://github.com/Mohanakri/AWS_SOA-Admin/assets/96922237/9299de73-9b07-4d94-aedd-af6a7498872f)

### Example Workflow:
1. `cfn-init` installs files and packages from metadata.
2. `cfn-signal` signals the status based on the success of `cfn-init`.

### Troubleshooting:
- Ensure the AMI includes the CloudFormation helper scripts.
- Verify that `cfn-init` and `cfn-signal` commands run successfully.

These scripts are crucial for managing the state and readiness of EC2 instances in CloudFormation stacks.
==========================================================================================
# 6.Creation Deletion Policies,DependsOn & wait conditions

This lesson covers advanced CloudFormation features, including creation and deletion policies, `DependsOn`, and `WaitConditions`.

![image](https://github.com/Mohanakri/AWS_SOA-Admin/assets/96922237/67205580-fea2-4684-89f0-7c6f265ccbe7)

![image](https://github.com/Mohanakri/AWS_SOA-Admin/assets/96922237/51c23861-9ce5-4f1a-a1a2-1b8d0d097fc0)

### Creation Policy:
- **Purpose**: To wait on resource configuration actions before proceeding with stack creation.
- **Function**: Prevents a resource’s status from reaching `CREATE_COMPLETE` until CloudFormation receives the required number of success signals or a specified timeout period is exceeded.
- **Supported Resources**: Auto-scaling groups, EC2 instances, and CloudFormation `WaitCondition`.
- **Signaling**: Use the `cfn-signal` helper script or the signal resource API.

![image](https://github.com/Mohanakri/AWS_SOA-Admin/assets/96922237/69859270-1add-4a49-b8aa-0c86afe40f92)

### Deletion Policy:
- **Purpose**: To preserve or back up a resource when its stack is deleted.
- **Options**:
  - **Retain**: Preserves the resource.
  - **Snapshot**: Takes a snapshot of the resource (e.g., EBS volumes, ElasticCache, RDS).
  - **Delete**: Default behavior, deletes the resource.

![image](https://github.com/Mohanakri/AWS_SOA-Admin/assets/96922237/4533cd46-f7cf-4948-99f0-6bec03fa7228)

### `DependsOn` Attribute:
- **Purpose**: To create resource dependencies.
- **Function**: Ensures that a resource is created only after another specified resource is created.
- **Example**: Creating an EC2 instance only after a database is created.

![image](https://github.com/Mohanakri/AWS_SOA-Admin/assets/96922237/cf4409f7-8b83-4b44-afb6-4496da477b6f)

### WaitCondition:
- **Purpose**: To ensure resources are ready before proceeding.
- **Use Cases**:
  - Coordinating stack resource creation with external configuration actions.
  - Tracking the status of a configuration process.
- **Example**: Waiting for a desired number of instances in a web server group.

![image](https://github.com/Mohanakri/AWS_SOA-Admin/assets/96922237/e9af4578-6a49-4135-a12f-3e42ab02569b)

### Update Policy and Update Replace Policy:
- **UpdatePolicy**: Specifies how CloudFormation handles updates to certain resources (e.g., auto-scaling groups, ElasticCache replication groups, Elasticsearch domains, Lambda aliases).
- **UpdateReplacePolicy**: Defines whether to retain or back up existing resources during a stack update that requires resource replacement.
  - **Function**: During an update that generates a new physical ID, ensures the old version is retained or backed up (e.g., taking a snapshot of an EC2 instance volume).

These features provide finer control over the creation, updating, and deletion of resources in CloudFormation stacks, ensuring dependencies and readiness are properly managed.
=======================================================================================
# 7.Rollbacks & Stack Creation Failures

This lesson covers rollbacks and stack creation failures in CloudFormation, important for understanding specific scenarios, especially for exams.

![image](https://github.com/Mohanakri/AWS_SOA-Admin/assets/96922237/457fb312-284f-452f-b738-6ce6243e0bb2)

### Stack Creation Failures:
- **Default Behavior**: All resources are deleted.
- **OnFailure Attribute Options**:
  - **Do Nothing**: Leaves resources in place for troubleshooting.
  - **Rollback**: Rolls the stack back, removing all resources to return to the original state.
  - **Delete**: Deletes all resources created during the failed stack creation.

![image](https://github.com/Mohanakri/AWS_SOA-Admin/assets/96922237/31f6aeb5-0414-45c3-b048-932a66f8214a)

### Stack Update Failures:
- **Update Rollback Failed State**: Occurs when CloudFormation cannot roll back all changes during an update.
- **Automatic Rollback**: Stack automatically rolls back to the previous working state.
- **Resolving Update Rollback Failed State**:
  - Continue rolling back to a working state (update rollback complete).
  - You cannot update a stack in the update rollback failed state, but you can attempt to roll it back to its original settings and then retry the update.

Understanding these behaviors is crucial for managing stack failures and rollbacks in CloudFormation.
=======================================================================================
# 8.Deploy Advance Template:Hands_ON

In this lesson, you learn to use an advanced CloudFormation template to create an infrastructure that includes an Elastic Load Balancer with auto-scaled instances. Here's a summary of the key steps and concepts covered:

1. **Template Source**:
   - The template is sourced from a webpage with various templates for different AWS services.
   - The chosen template sets up an Elastic Load Balancer with auto-scaled instances.

2. **Parameters**:
   - Parameters like VPC ID, subnets, instance type, key name, and SSH location are defined.
   - When launching the template, these parameters need to be specified.

3. **Launching the Template**:
   - You upload the template file, configure the parameters, and create the stack in CloudFormation.
   - Example: Instance type set to t2.micro, key name specified, default VPC and subnets selected.

4. **Template Details**:
   - **Mappings**: Region-specific settings and architecture configurations.
   - **Resources**:
     - Web server group (auto-scaling group)
     - Launch configuration (installing packages like HTTPD)
     - Application Load Balancer, listener, and target group
     - Security groups
   - **CloudFormation Initialization**:
     - Installs packages and configures the web server.
     - Utilizes metadata and user data for setup.

5. **Outputs**:
   - The output includes a URL to access the deployed application.
   - The URL is constructed using the `Fn::Join` and `GetAtt` functions to append the load balancer's DNS name.

6. **Verification**:
   - Once the stack creation is complete, you can access the web application via the output URL.
   - The web page includes an image linked to an AWS region-specific URL.

7. **Cleanup**:
   - After verifying the application, the stack is deleted to clean up all resources.

This exercise demonstrates the practical application of advanced CloudFormation template features, including parameters, mappings, resources, and outputs.
=======================================================================================
# 9.AWS Resource Access Manager

![image](https://github.com/Mohanakri/AWS_SOA-Admin/assets/96922237/49efa120-d625-43cb-8dea-eec386339da8)

![image](https://github.com/Mohanakri/AWS_SOA-Admin/assets/96922237/aadae3c1-03ad-4fd1-8ecf-ab07b1592617)

In this lesson, we cover AWS Resource Access Manager (RAM), which allows sharing of resources within and across AWS accounts, including subnets, databases, and resource groups. RAM supports sharing within AWS organizations, Organizational Units (OUs), and with IAM roles and users for specific resources. Resource shares can be created through the RAM console, APIs, CLI, or SDK. The lesson references a web page for a detailed list of sharable resources, such as transit gateways and subnets in Amazon VPC. The next lesson will demonstrate RAM in action through the AWS console.
========================================================================================
# 10.Amazon Elastic Beanstalk

AWS Elastic Beanstalk is a service that automates the creation and management of web applications on Amazon EC2. It sets up the entire environment, including EC2 instances, web application environments (e.g., Node.js), auto-scaling groups, load balancers, and optionally, Amazon RDS. It's a Platform as a Service (PaaS) solution with a narrower scope compared to AWS CloudFormation, focusing on managing web app environments.

![image](https://github.com/Mohanakri/AWS_SOA-Admin/assets/96922237/5e15a8d8-800d-4067-8db2-a3bcf59e0726)

![image](https://github.com/Mohanakri/AWS_SOA-Admin/assets/96922237/ea6e89f7-a155-4a10-be6a-daffefea56c4)

Elastic Beanstalk supports various languages and stacks such as Java, .NET, PHP, Node.js, Python, Ruby, Go, and Docker. Developers can upload their code (e.g., in a zip file) to Beanstalk, which provisions the necessary resources and deploys the application.

![image](https://github.com/Mohanakri/AWS_SOA-Admin/assets/96922237/65ef8b89-c946-44ec-9ea1-4955faf944ed)

Elastic Beanstalk components include:
- **Applications**: Contain environments, configurations, and application versions.
- **Environments**: Deployable application versions on AWS resources, which include web servers and worker environments. Web servers handle HTTP requests, while workers process long-running tasks from an Amazon SQS queue.

In summary, Elastic Beanstalk simplifies deploying and managing web applications by handling the provisioning and management of underlying infrastructure.
=====================================================================================
# 11.Elastic Beanstalk Deployment Scenarios

In this lesson, various deployment scenarios for AWS Elastic Beanstalk applications are covered:

![image](https://github.com/Mohanakri/AWS_SOA-Admin/assets/96922237/b7a7d059-bc60-43d7-8af4-6ac7479ef2c0)

![image](https://github.com/Mohanakri/AWS_SOA-Admin/assets/96922237/7da2aa46-7d22-4de7-9733-9e4a63df9c8a)

![image](https://github.com/Mohanakri/AWS_SOA-Admin/assets/96922237/316f8c72-103d-4e5c-90b3-9dd0f52d8c25)

1. **All at Once**: Updates are applied to all instances simultaneously, causing a temporary outage. It's the fastest method, suitable for development but not for production.

![image](https://github.com/Mohanakri/AWS_SOA-Admin/assets/96922237/8f571b44-9b97-44d9-8e1e-c031d08e6854)

![image](https://github.com/Mohanakri/AWS_SOA-Admin/assets/96922237/873edda5-ca31-44f1-8eee-8bc3fcd9cc43)

2. **Rolling**: Updates are applied in batches, with each batch taken out of service during the update. This maintains partial service but can cause reduced capacity and longer deployment times.

![image](https://github.com/Mohanakri/AWS_SOA-Admin/assets/96922237/368600bb-d8b6-441c-8619-aa13105c0278)

![image](https://github.com/Mohanakri/AWS_SOA-Admin/assets/96922237/93041889-2418-4fd9-acf5-d2d99bdc671c)

3. **Rolling with Additional Batch**: Similar to rolling, but with an extra batch of instances to maintain full capacity. There's a small additional cost and longer deployment time.

![image](https://github.com/Mohanakri/AWS_SOA-Admin/assets/96922237/4c344627-01c5-4640-8873-0d02bc8c03aa)

![image](https://github.com/Mohanakri/AWS_SOA-Admin/assets/96922237/32abbb0d-dcc7-4879-a41a-dca518c0d8c8)

4. **Immutable**: A new auto-scaling group (ASG) is created with the new version. Once healthy, traffic is switched to the new ASG, ensuring no downtime. It's costly and time-consuming but offers a quick rollback.

![image](https://github.com/Mohanakri/AWS_SOA-Admin/assets/96922237/5437423e-f29e-41d7-b26e-54e427cd01ca)

5. **Blue/Green**: A new staging environment is created with Route 53 weighted routing to direct traffic. This method allows independent validation and easy rollback by swapping URLs. It avoids downtime but isn't a direct Elastic Beanstalk feature.

![image](https://github.com/Mohanakri/AWS_SOA-Admin/assets/96922237/778e6044-08f7-4b7d-ba47-21a250c445eb)

![image](https://github.com/Mohanakri/AWS_SOA-Admin/assets/96922237/e6542916-de7c-4991-85d4-afe95a68eb74)

Additionally, Elastic Beanstalk supports two environment tiers:

![image](https://github.com/Mohanakri/AWS_SOA-Admin/assets/96922237/51c39edc-2790-4e0d-9f5b-44468e3e33c7)

- **Web Servers**: Handle HTTP requests over port 80 or 443.

  ![image](https://github.com/Mohanakri/AWS_SOA-Admin/assets/96922237/01727c48-26c6-4fc8-b6ff-2b96d67eb9dc)

- **Workers**: Process long-running tasks from an Amazon SQS queue.

Overall, these deployment strategies provide different balances of speed, cost, and downtime, making Elastic Beanstalk versatile for various environments and needs.
========================================================================================
# 12.Deploy Beanstalk Application:Hands_ON

In this lesson, the instructor demonstrates deploying an AWS Elastic Beanstalk application, updating the application with new code, and using the swap URLs feature. 

Key steps covered:
1. **Creating a New Beanstalk Application**:
   - Use the Elastic Beanstalk console to create a new application.
   - Choose a platform (e.g., Node.js).
   - Utilize sample application code provided by AWS.

2. **Exploring Configuration Options**:
   - View and adjust various configurations such as instance types, load balancers, and security settings.
   - Confirm the creation of the application and environment, which involves CloudFormation stack setup.

3. **Uploading and Deploying a New Version**:
   - Modify the application code (e.g., changing the background color in `index.html`).
   - Compress the updated code and upload it as a new application version.
   - Deploy the new version to the existing environment.

4. **Creating a Second Environment**:
   - Set up a second environment with the original sample application to enable testing and validation.
   - Verify the successful deployment by accessing the distinct URLs for each environment (one with a blue background and the other with the original green background).

5. **Swapping URLs**:
   - Use the swap URLs feature to redirect live traffic from one environment to the other.
   - Verify that the URLs now point to the updated application in the respective environments.

# 14. Run EventBridge Event on a Shedule:Hands_ON

In this hands-on lesson, we learn how to create an EventBridge event that triggers on a schedule and executes a Lambda function. The steps include:

1. **Creating a Lambda Function**: 
   - Named "event bridge test".
   - Set to run on Node.js 16.
   - Used default execution role.
   - Deployed with provided Lambda code, which logs a message from EventBridge to CloudWatch Logs.

2. **Setting Up EventBridge**:
   - Chose the "schedule" option on the EventBridge main page.
   - Named the schedule "event bridge test".
   - Selected a one-time schedule with a specific date and time.
   - Chose the Lambda function as the target and provided the payload data.

3. **Monitoring Execution**:
   - Confirmed the event execution by checking CloudWatch Logs, which showed the expected message logged from EventBridge.

The process demonstrated how to use EventBridge to schedule and trigger Lambda functions, and how to verify the execution through CloudWatch Logs.

# 15.Create & Manage AMI's:Hands_ON

In this lesson, we learned how to create and manage Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) in the EC2 management console. Here's a summary of the steps:

1. **Prepare an Instance**: Start with a running EC2 instance. If you don't have one, launch an instance with any preferred settings.

2. **Snapshots**: Check for existing snapshots. You can create an AMI from a snapshot or directly from a live instance.

3. **Creating an AMI**:
   - **From Snapshot**: Use an existing snapshot to create an AMI that reflects the instance's configuration at the time of the snapshot.
   - **From Live Instance**: Choose actions > images and templates > create image. You can decide whether to allow a reboot for a consistent snapshot or take a live snapshot using the "no reboot" option.
   - Name the AMI and configure volume settings if necessary.

4. **Monitoring**: The AMI creation process generates a new snapshot. Check the snapshots section for the new snapshot and the AMI section for the pending AMI.

5. **Visibility and Sharing**: By default, the AMI is private. You can edit AMI permissions to share it with other accounts or make it public.

6. **Using the AMI**: Launch a new instance from the created AMI via the EC2 console by browsing more AMIs and selecting the created one.

7. **Cleanup**: To delete the snapshot associated with an AMI, first deregister the AMI, then delete the snapshot.

These steps outline the process of managing AMIs and snapshots efficiently, including creating, launching, sharing, and cleaning up resources.

**DynamoDB:**
- A fully managed NoSQL database service known as a key-value and document store.
- It is non-relational, fully serverless, and scales seamlessly by distributing data across partitions and multiple AZs for durability.
- Offers low latency in the millisecond range.
- Global tables feature allows multi-region synchronization and multi-master solutions.

**DAX:**
- Provides microsecond latency by running on EC2 instances in front of DynamoDB.
- Requires deploying a cluster of DAX instances and pointing them to the database.

The lesson also includes a hands-on demonstration of creating a DynamoDB table:
1. Create a table named "product catalog" with "ID" as the partition key.
2. Load data into the table using a JSON file and AWS CloudShell.
3. Observe the flexibility of the non-relational database schema, which allows varied attribute formats and optional attributes.

Finally, the lesson demonstrates how to delete the DynamoDB table and associated CloudWatch alarms.
