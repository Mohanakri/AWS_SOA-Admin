# 1.Advance IAM:RBAC & ABAC
In this lesson, two AWS IAM access control techniques are discussed: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) and Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC).
![image](https://github.com/Mohanakri/AWS_SOA-Admin/assets/96922237/89c9c21f-f932-4016-88c5-5e8c0d8001d6)
![image](https://github.com/Mohanakri/AWS_SOA-Admin/assets/96922237/6ffd7296-7b2c-4118-8acd-54369b2be902)

**Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):**
- Users are grouped based on job roles, with policies attached to groups to define permissions.
- Permissions vary by job role (e.g., admin, development, operations) and follow the principle of least privilege.
- AWS managed policies can be used for common job roles, or custom policies can be created.
![image](https://github.com/Mohanakri/AWS_SOA-Admin/assets/96922237/0e0b8483-3e88-4e53-83e1-0728c0478fbc)

**Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC):**
- Uses tags attached to IAM users and resources to control access.
- An example is given where a user (Dave) with a tag indicating his department (DB Admins) has permissions based on specific conditions.
- ABAC can enforce policies based on attributes like environment tags (e.g., production or development).

**Comparison of Identity-Based and Resource-Based Policies:**
- Identity-based policies are attached to users, groups, or roles.
- Resource-based policies are attached to AWS resources (e.g., S3 bucket policies) and include a principal element defining who has access.
- IAM policies include elements like effect (allow/deny), actions (specific API operations), and resources (which resources are affected).

**Examples of IAM Policies:**
- Policies can have conditions, such as restricting actions to a specific AWS region or IP address ranges.
- Understanding IAM policy syntax and structure is crucial for interpreting what actions are allowed or denied.

The lesson emphasizes the importance of knowing how to read and understand IAM policies, especially for AWS certification exams.
=========================================================================================
# 2.IAM Evaluation

In this lesson, the process of IAM policy evaluation in AWS is explained, focusing on how AWS decides whether to allow or deny access to a resource.

1. **Initial Decision**: Every request starts with an implicit deny.
2. **Policy Evaluation**: AWS evaluates applicable policies to look for an explicit deny. If found, the request is denied.
3. **Service Control Policy (SCP)**: Checks if the principal's account is part of an organization with an SCP. If no allow is found, the request is denied.
4. **Resource-Based Policy**: If the resource has a resource-based policy, AWS checks for an allow. If not found, it moves on.
5. **Identity-Based Policy**: If applicable, AWS checks the identity-based policy for an allow.
6. **Permissions Boundary**: If a permissions boundary applies, AWS checks for an allow within it.
7. **Session Policy**: For session principals, AWS checks for an allow in the session policy.
![image](https://github.com/Mohanakri/AWS_SOA-Admin/assets/96922237/f64e411b-7995-494c-8863-c71a81665099)
![image](https://github.com/Mohanakri/AWS_SOA-Admin/assets/96922237/46075713-f29f-43ee-8335-329d708d8563)

The process ensures that an explicit deny always overrides any allows. 

**Authorization Steps**:
1. **Authentication**: Verifying the identity of the requester.
2. **Request Context Formation**: Includes action, resource, principal, and environment data.
3. **Policy Evaluation**: AWS evaluates identity-based and resource-based policies to determine access.
![image](https://github.com/Mohanakri/AWS_SOA-Admin/assets/96922237/019db956-b8db-41bc-af1d-e5a51b8e2fbc)

**Types of Policies**:
- **Identity-Based Policies**: Attached to users, groups, and roles.
- **Resource-Based Policies**: Attached to resources.
- **Permissions Boundaries**: Set maximum permissions for identity-based policies.
- **Service Control Policies (SCPs)**: Set maximum permissions for organizations.
- **Session Policies**: Used with assumed role actions.
![image](https://github.com/Mohanakri/AWS_SOA-Admin/assets/96922237/91f4e4e1-18f1-4f0e-9ee3-28224f0de5dd)

**Effective Permissions**:
- The final permissions are the intersection of permissions allowed by identity-based policies, resource-based policies, permissions boundaries, and SCPs.
![image](https://github.com/Mohanakri/AWS_SOA-Admin/assets/96922237/04dc9850-1c37-4525-8aff-f8a7f7442dfd)

**Key Rules**:
- All requests are implicitly denied by default.
- Explicit allow overrides implicit deny.
- Permissions boundaries and SCPs can impose further restrictions.
- An explicit deny in any policy overrides all allows.
====================================================================================
# 3.Cross-Account Access:Hands_ON

In this lesson, you learn how to use cross-account access to assume a role and access an S3 bucket in AWS.
![image](https://github.com/Mohanakri/AWS_SOA-Admin/assets/96922237/c6d818e9-eeaf-45ed-bc68-38ba975800ec)

1. **Setup**:
   - **Accounts**: You need two AWS accounts. Account A has the S3 bucket and the role, while Account B has the user.
   - **S3 Bucket**: The bucket in Account A is private with no public access.

2. **Role and Permissions**:
   - **Role Creation**: In Account A, create a role that Account B can assume.
   - **Permissions Policy**: The role's permissions policy allows access to the S3 bucket.
   - **Trust Policy**: The trust policy includes an external ID, acting as a passphrase.

3. **Commands**:
   - **CLI Command**: Use the AWS CLI to assume the role with the `sts assume-role` command, including the external ID.
   - **Create Bucket**: Use the `AWS S3 MB` command to create a new bucket (e.g., "cross account test").
   - **Upload File**: Upload a file to the bucket.

4. **Role Setup**:
   - **IAM Role**: Create the IAM role in Account A, specifying Account B as the trusted entity and requiring the external ID.
   - **Policy Attachment**: Attach an inline policy to the role, granting necessary S3 actions (get object, put object, list bucket).

5. **Assuming the Role**:
   - **Switch Roles**: Switch roles to Account B and use CloudShell to run the `sts assume-role` command.
   - **Temporary Credentials**: The command provides temporary security credentials (access key ID, secret access key, session token).
   - **Configure Credentials**: Use `AWS configure set` to configure these credentials on the command line.

6. **Access S3 Bucket**:
   - **List Bucket**: Use the configured profile to list the contents of the S3 bucket in Account A, verifying cross-account access.
   - **Remove Credentials**: Deleting the credentials file and rerunning the list command without the profile results in access denied, showing the importance of the assumed role.

This process demonstrates how to assume a role using the AWS CLI, configure temporary credentials, and access resources in another AWS account securely.
======================================================================================
# 4.MFA with the AWS CLI:Hands_ON

This lesson demonstrates how to use multi-factor authentication (MFA) with the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI).

1. **Setup**:
   - **Virtual MFA Device**: Ensure you have a virtual MFA device configured in your AWS account.
   - **Serial Number**: Copy the serial number of the virtual MFA device from your account's security credentials.

2. **Get Session Token**:
   - **Command**: Use the `aws sts get-session-token` command to obtain temporary security credentials.
   - **Token Code**: Enter the current token code generated by the MFA device when prompted.

3. **Configure CLI**:
   - **Environment Variables**: Configure the CLI on your computer. If using Mac or Linux, use `export`; for Windows, use `set`.
   - **Credentials**: Copy the access key ID, secret access key, and session token into environment variables.

4. **Execution**:
   - **Verify Access**: Run an AWS CLI command (e.g., `aws s3 ls`) to verify access using the temporary credentials.
   - **Backup Credentials**: Backup your original credentials file and delete it to ensure you are using the temporary credentials.

5. **Undo Changes**:
   - **Unset Environment Variables**: Run commands to unset the environment variables to remove the temporary credentials.
   - **Restore Credentials**: Copy the backup credentials file back to the original location to restore access.

This process ensures secure access to AWS resources using MFA with the CLI by generating temporary credentials and configuring them as environment variables.
=======================================================================================
# 5.Access Evaluation Tools:Hands_ON

In this lesson, we explore several tools in the IAM Management Console to evaluate and manage user access in AWS accounts:

1. **Access Analyzer**:
   - **Enable Access Analyzer**: Quickly set it up with a single click.
   - **Findings**: Identifies potential access issues such as public access permissions on S3 buckets and IAM roles. 
   - **Details and Actions**: Provides detailed access levels and allows you to address any concerns.

2. **Credential Report**:
   - **Downloadable Report**: Provides information on user accounts, including creation dates, console access, password usage, MFA status, and more.
   - **Security Overview**: Helps in understanding user credentials from a security perspective.

3. **IAM Policy Simulator**:
   - **Simulate User Access**: Select a user, choose a service (e.g., EC2, S3), and specific actions to simulate and verify permissions.
   - **Results**: Shows allowed and denied actions based on the applied policies.

4. **Role Permissions Generator**:
   - **Generate Policy Based on CloudTrail Events**: For roles with multiple policies, this tool generates policies based on recent CloudTrail events.
   - **Customize and Apply Policies**: Review, edit, and apply generated policies to ensure roles have the necessary permissions.

These tools assist in analyzing, simulating, and managing access permissions to ensure secure and appropriate user and role access in AWS.

By understanding these tools and concepts, you can effectively manage multiple AWS accounts, enforce security policies, and ensure compliance within your AWS environment.
========================================================================================
# 7.Organizations & SCP's:Hands_ON

In this lesson, the instructor demonstrates how to create an AWS organization and apply a Service Control Policy (SCP) to restrict certain actions in a development (DEV) account. The steps are as follows:
![image](https://github.com/Mohanakri/AWS_SOA-Admin/assets/96922237/8449ea76-4721-45ef-ab06-c37ce594734a)

1. **Create an Organization**: 
   - Navigate to AWS Organizations and create a new organization with a default policy allowing all actions.

2. **Add a DEV Account**: 
   - Use the "Add an AWS account" option to create a DEV account, specifying a unique email and keeping the role as "OrganizationAccountAccessRole".

3. **Create an Organizational Unit (OU)**:
   - Create a new OU named "ou1" and move the DEV account into this OU.

4. **Enable Service Control Policies**:
   - Enable SCPs in the organization. The default "FullAWSAccess" policy allows all actions and is inherited by all accounts and OUs.

5. **Create and Attach a Custom SCP**:
   - Create a new SCP named "RequireT2Micro" that only allows launching T2 micro instances. Attach this policy to "ou1".

6. **Test the SCP**:
   - Switch roles into the DEV account using the "OrganizationAccountAccessRole".
   - Attempt to launch an EC2 instance of type T2 micro (which should succeed) and another type (which should fail, demonstrating the SCP's restriction).

7. **Switch Back to Original Account**:
   - After testing, switch back to the original management account.

The demonstration showcases how SCPs can effectively control and restrict API actions within specific AWS accounts, ensuring compliance with organizational policies.
=========================================================================================
# 8.Directory Services & Federation

In this lesson, you learn about AWS directory services and federation. The key points are:
![image](https://github.com/Mohanakri/AWS_SOA-Admin/assets/96922237/5f85ff0f-f6f6-4d9a-91d3-ae305f6ed1fa)

========================================================================================
# 10.Encryption Primer

In this lesson, the focus is on the basics of encryption, covering the differences between various types of encryption used in AWS. The key points are:
![image](https://github.com/Mohanakri/AWS_SOA-Admin/assets/96922237/0bdcca45-d6b0-4739-be64-b580ba981be5)
![image](https://github.com/Mohanakri/AWS_SOA-Admin/assets/96922237/4c5fed22-feee-4ab8-ad07-27cee1b378c3)

1. **Encryption in Transit vs. Encryption at Rest**:
   - **Encryption in Transit**: Encrypts data as it traverses a network, such as through an HTTPS connection. The data is encrypted while being transmitted, but may not be encrypted once it reaches its destination.
   - **Encryption at Rest**: Encrypts the actual data itself when it is stored. For example, data stored in Amazon S3 can be encrypted at rest.
![image](https://github.com/Mohanakri/AWS_SOA-Admin/assets/96922237/37588c53-f8e5-4c05-ba2b-2dd3933d5f9f)

2. **Asymmetric vs. Symmetric Encryption**:
   - **Asymmetric Encryption (Public Key Cryptography)**: Involves a pair of keys—public and private. Data encrypted with the public key can only be decrypted with the private key, and vice versa. Examples include SSL/TLS and SSH.
   - **Symmetric Encryption**: Uses a single key for both encryption and decryption. The same key is used for both processes, unlike asymmetric encryption.

Understanding these fundamental concepts helps in grasping how AWS services like KMS keys, Cloud HSM, and AWS Certificate Manager utilize encryption.
========================================================================================
# 11.Key Management Service (KMS)

The lesson on AWS Key Management Service (KMS) explains its use in creating and managing encryption keys, both symmetric and asymmetric, which are securely stored in hardware security modules (HSM). 
![image](https://github.com/Mohanakri/AWS_SOA-Admin/assets/96922237/4ed073ef-3eb6-49e7-8069-2cfdf81d153c)

- **Types of Keys**:
  - **Customer Managed Keys**: Created and managed by developers.
  - **AWS Managed Keys**: Created and managed by AWS, integrated with various AWS services (e.g., SQS, ACM, EBS, FSX).

- **Key Material and Encryption**:
  - KMS keys can encrypt data up to 4KB. For larger data volumes, KMS generates data encryption keys (DEKs).
  - Keys can be stored outside of KMS using options like External Key Store (XKS) and Custom Key Store (CloudHSM).

- **Key Management**:
  - **AWS Managed Keys**: Integrated with many services but cannot be directly managed by users.
  - **Data Encryption Keys (DEKs)**: Used for encrypting large data volumes, managed outside of KMS.

![image](https://github.com/Mohanakri/AWS_SOA-Admin/assets/96922237/b154a380-97c9-432b-8ef4-07681baaf5ef)

- **Key Rotation**:
  - **Customer Managed Keys**: Optional yearly rotation.
  - **AWS Managed Keys**: Mandatory yearly rotation.
  - **AWS Owned Keys**: Fully managed by AWS, no user control.
![image](https://github.com/Mohanakri/AWS_SOA-Admin/assets/96922237/191d76cd-75ad-4a60-84f7-ab80f0691f21)

# 12.Create KMS Key:Hands_ON

In this lesson, we learn how to create an AWS Key Management Service (KMS) key and use it to encrypt Elastic Block Store (EBS) volumes. Here are the steps covered:

1. **Create a KMS Key**:
   - Navigate to the Key Management Service in the AWS Management Console.
   - Create a symmetric key for encryption and decryption.
   - Assign an alias to the key (e.g., "my EBS key").
   - Set administrative permissions (e.g., your user account).
   - Assign key usage permissions, including permissions for the AWS service role for auto-scaling.
   - Review and finalize the key policy.

2. **Configure EC2 Instance with Encrypted EBS Volume**:
   - Go to the EC2 service and create a launch template.
   - Select the Amazon Linux 2 AMI, T2.micro instance type, and configure security groups.
   - Under storage settings, enable encryption for the root EBS volume using the newly created KMS key.
   - Create the launch template.

3. **Create an Auto Scaling Group**:
   - Set up an auto-scaling group using the launch template.
   - Configure subnets, and other settings, and launch the auto-scaling group.
   - Verify that the instance is launched with the encrypted volume using the specified KMS key.

4. **Verify Encryption**:
   - Check the EBS volume attached to the instance to ensure encryption is enabled and using the correct KMS key.

5. **Clean Up**:
   - Delete the auto-scaling group when finished.
   - Disable the KMS key and schedule it for deletion (minimum of seven days).

This process ensures that your EBS volumes are securely encrypted using a custom KMS key, and provides a mechanism for key management and deletion to maintain security.

![image](https://github.com/Mohanakri/AWS_SOA-Admin/assets/96922237/af968aec-54ac-41ee-9ccd-5deb9f86fd33)

**Key API and CLI Commands:**

1. **Encrypt**: 
   - API: `encrypt`
   - CLI: `aws kms encrypt`
   - Encrypts plain text using a KMS key.

2. **Decrypt**:
   - Decrypts cipher text that was encrypted by a KMS key.

3. **Re-encrypt**:
   - Decrypts and re-encrypts data within KMS to change the KMS key or encryption context.

4. **Enable-key-rotation**:
   - Enables automatic rotation of the key material for a specified symmetric KMS key.

5. **GenerateDataKey**:
   - Generates a unique symmetric data key, returning both plain text and encrypted copies.

6. **GenerateDataKeyWithoutPlaintext**:
   - Generates a unique symmetric data key and returns only the encrypted copy.

7. **GenerateDataKeyPair** and **GenerateDataKeyPairWithoutPlaintext**:
   - Generates asymmetric data key pairs.
![image](https://github.com/Mohanakri/AWS_SOA-Admin/assets/96922237/b7801570-9c7a-49ae-9b67-5638bfa1bf52)

**Throttling and Caching:**

- **Resource Quotas**: Limits on the number of resources you can create.
- **Request Quotas**: Limits on the rate of API actions like encrypt, decrypt, etc.
  - **Throttling Errors**: Occur when request quotas are exceeded, resulting in a `throttling exception` error.

**Strategies to Manage Throttling:**

1. **Backoff and Retry Strategy**:
   - Implement code that waits and retries requests to reduce frequency.

2. **Service Quota Increase**:
   - Request an increase if you need to consistently generate a large number of API actions.

3. **Data Key Caching**:
   - Store data keys and cryptographic material in a local cache using AWS Encryption SDK.
   - Useful for applications that can reuse data keys and need faster cryptographic operations.

This lesson provided essential knowledge for understanding KMS operations and managing potential throttling issues effectively.

- **Importing Certificates**: Allows importing certificates from third-party issuers and key material to create certificates in AWS.

In summary, ACM is used for encryption in transit (SSL/TLS certificates), while AWS KMS or CloudHSM are used for encryption at rest (cryptographic keys). This distinction is crucial for understanding their roles in AWS security services.
===================================================================================
# 16.Managing ACM Certificates:Hands_ON

In this lesson, you learn how to use AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) to create and manage SSL/TLS certificates.

1. **Certificate Manager Console**: 
   - You can list, request, and import certificates.
   - To import, you need the certificate body, private key, and certificate chain.

2. **Requesting a Certificate**:
   - You need a Route 53 domain name.
   - Add fully qualified domain names (e.g., "example.com" and "www.example.com").
   - Two validation methods: DNS (recommended) and email.
   - For DNS validation, create CNAME records in your hosted zone to prove domain ownership.

3. **Process**:
   - Request a certificate and choose DNS validation.
   - AWS provides CNAME records to add to Route 53.
   - Use the "Create records in Route 53" option for automatic setup.
   - Once validated, the certificate is issued.

4. **Post-Validation**:
   - You can delete the CNAME records after validation.
   - The certificate can be used later with CloudFront and an Application Load Balancer.

The certificate is now ready for use in subsequent lessons with CloudFront and a load balancer.
