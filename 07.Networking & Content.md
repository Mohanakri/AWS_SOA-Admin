# 1.Pravite Subnets & NAT Gateways

This lesson explains the concepts and differences between public and private subnets, as well as the role of NAT gateways in a VPC. 
![image](https://github.com/Mohanakri/AWS_SOA-Admin/assets/96922237/0a1715c5-2e48-4188-89bc-5ed4a62b2843)

### Public Subnets:
- **Public Subnets Requirements:**
  - Must have a route to an internet gateway in the route table.
  - The auto-assign public IPv4 or IPv6 addresses setting must be applied so instances get both public and private IPs.
- **Connectivity:**
  - Instances in public subnets can be accessed directly from the internet using a key pair for authentication.

### Private Subnets:
- **Private Subnets Characteristics:**
  - Do not assign public IP addresses.
  - Do not have a route to an internet gateway, hence only private IPs are assigned to instances.
- **Access Methods:**
  - Use a public instance (bastion host) for indirect access via agent forwarding or by storing a private key on the public instance.

### NAT Gateways:
- **Purpose:**
  - Enable instances in private subnets to access the internet.
- **Requirements:**
  - Must be deployed in a public subnet.
  - Must have an elastic IP attached.
  - Route to the NAT gateway must be added to the private subnetâ€™s route table.
- **Functionality:**
  - Provides a single public IP (the elastic IP) for outgoing traffic.
- **Redundancy:**
  - NAT gateways are highly available within an availability zone.
  - For redundancy, deploy NAT gateways across multiple availability zones, each with its own route table pointing to its specific NAT gateway.

This ensures that if one AZ fails, instances in other AZs can still access the internet.
=========================================================================================
# 2.Lunch NAT Gateway:Hands_ON

This lesson guides users through creating a NAT gateway in a public subnet, setting up private subnets, launching an EC2 instance in one of those private subnets, and verifying outbound internet access via the NAT gateway using the AWS CLI.

### Steps:

1. **Create Private Subnets:**
   - Create private subnets in `us-east-1a` and `us-east-1b`.
   - Use the default VPC ID in three places in the provided document.
   - Run commands to create private subnets and tag them.

2. **Create a Route Table:**
   - Create a route table in the default VPC, tagged as `private-RT`.
   - Associate the private subnets with this route table.

3. **Create NAT Gateway:**
   - Allocate an elastic IP.
   - Create the NAT gateway in a public subnet using the allocated elastic IP and public subnet ID.

4. **Update Route Table:**
   - Add a route to the NAT gateway in the route table associated with the private subnets.

5. **Launch EC2 Instance:**
   - Create a security group allowing all outbound traffic but no inbound traffic.
   - Launch an EC2 instance in a private subnet with the appropriate security group and instance profile.

6. **Use Systems Manager for Connection:**
   - Use Systems Manager Session Manager to connect to the EC2 instance, ensuring outbound access is allowed via the NAT gateway.

7. **Verification:**
   - Verify internet connectivity from the private instance by pinging an external site (e.g., google.com).

8. **Cleanup:**
   - Delete the NAT gateway and release the elastic IP to avoid ongoing charges.
   - Terminate the EC2 instance to prevent further costs.

### Key Points:
- **NAT Gateway Requirements:**
  - Must reside in a public subnet.
  - Private subnets route table must point to the NAT gateway for outbound access.
- **Security and Costs:**
  - Use Systems Manager Session Manager for secure access without opening inbound ports.
  - Ensure to delete the NAT gateway and release elastic IPs to avoid charges.

This hands-on exercise demonstrates setting up and utilizing a NAT gateway for internet access from instances in private subnets, emphasizing the importance of proper configuration and cost management.

![image](https://github.com/Mohanakri/AWS_SOA-Admin/assets/96922237/6d9ab873-2f9a-4003-bbdf-adde8705c83e)

### Steps to Configure VPC Peering

1. **Setup with CloudFormation:**
   - **Regions:** US East 1 (North Virginia) and US West 1 (North California).
   - **CIDR Blocks:** 10.100.0.0/16 and 10.0.0.0/16.
   - **Security Groups:** Allow SSH from anywhere, and ICMP only from the other VPC's CIDR block.
   - **Components:** Internet gateway, VPC gateway attachment, public subnet, route table, and security groups.

2. **Creating the Stacks:**
   - Launch CloudFormation stacks in both regions using provided YAML templates.
   - Each stack creates a VPC, an EC2 instance with a web server, and the necessary security group rules.

3. **Configuring Security Groups:**
   - Ensure security group rules allow ICMP traffic only from the other VPC.
   - Modify rules to restrict HTTP traffic to be allowed only across the peering connection.

4. **Creating VPC Peering Connection:**
   - In US East 1, initiate a peering connection targeting the VPC in US West 1.
   - Accept the peering request in US West 1.

5. **Updating Route Tables:**
   - Add route entries in each VPCâ€™s route table to route traffic to the other VPC via the peering connection.

6. **Testing the Connection:**
   - SSH into the instances and ping the private IP of the instance in the other VPC.
   - Use curl to verify HTTP access, ensuring that connections are using private IPs and adhering to security group rules.

### Cleanup

- **Delete Peering Connection:** Remove the peering connection, which will also delete related route table entries.
- **Delete CloudFormation Stacks:** After deleting the peering connection, delete the CloudFormation stacks to clean up all resources.

This process establishes a secure and private communication channel between instances in different VPCs across regions, leveraging AWS CloudFormation for automation and consistency.

![image](https://github.com/Mohanakri/AWS_SOA-Admin/assets/96922237/49f84e17-b524-4305-a8ca-47b3b243c7cf)

1. **DNS Forwarders:**
   - A DNS forwarder is used when a DNS server can't answer a query but knows where to forward the request.
   - The query can be recursive, passing through multiple DNS servers until a result is found.
   - Useful for resolving both internal company DNS names and external internet domain names.
![image](https://github.com/Mohanakri/AWS_SOA-Admin/assets/96922237/2e0dcf30-61f6-40c4-b646-5c6b54a48a8e)

2. **Route 53 Resolver:**
   - Integrates on-premises DNS servers with Route 53 DNS servers for seamless domain name resolution.
   - There are two types of Route 53 Resolver endpoints:
     - **Outbound Endpoints:** Allow EC2 instances in a VPC to query on-premises DNS servers.
       - The query goes to Route 53, then to the outbound endpoint, and is forwarded to the on-premises DNS server. The response is sent back via the outbound endpoint.
     - **Inbound Endpoints:** Allow on-premises clients to query Route 53 DNS records.
       - The on-premises DNS server forwards the query to the inbound endpoint, which then uses Route 53 to return the result.

3. **Example Configuration:**
   - **Outbound Endpoint:** VPC with EC2 instances connected to a corporate data center via VPN. Route 53 sends DNS queries to the outbound endpoint, which forwards them to the on-premises DNS server and returns the result.
   - **Inbound Endpoint:** Clients in the corporate data center query Route 53 records through the on-premises DNS server, which forwards the request to the inbound endpoint and gets the result from Route 53.

### Summary:
Route 53 Resolver enables the resolution of domain names across both on-premises DNS servers and Route 53 hosted zones, ensuring that EC2 instances and on-premises clients can access the necessary DNS records seamlessly. This lesson provides an overview of how to set up and use Route 53 Resolver with inbound and outbound endpoints.

   - Reduces latency by bringing content closer to users, minimizing physical distance and improving performance.

2. **Components of CloudFront:**
   - **Origin:** The source of the content, which can be Amazon S3, Amazon EC2, or EC2 behind a load balancer. The origin is located in a single region.
   - **Edge Locations:** Distributed globally, these locations cache content from the origin, making it closer to users and reducing latency.

3. **How CloudFront Works:**
   - Users access content from the nearest edge location, reducing latency and improving performance.
   - If content is not available at the edge location, it is retrieved from the origin via the AWS global network, ensuring lower latency compared to the public internet.

4. **Distribution and Endpoint:**
   - A distribution is created in CloudFront, providing an access endpoint (e.g., `abcd1234.cloudfront.net`).
   - Custom domain names can be used.
   - Multiple origins can be specified for a single distribution (e.g., S3 and EC2).

5. **Web Distribution:**
   - Speeds up delivery of static and dynamic content, accessible via HTTP or HTTPS.
   - Supports adding, updating, deleting objects, submitting data through web forms, and live streaming.
   - Behaviors within distributions allow specific configurations (e.g., path patterns, protocol policies, cache policies).

6. **Configuration Options:**
   - **Path Pattern:** Directs specific requests to different origins.
   - **Protocol Policy:** Ensures secure connections.
   - **Cache Policy:** Determines how long content stays in the cache.
   - **Origin Request Policy:** Configures security and other factors for edge-to-origin connections.

### Summary:
CloudFront enhances the performance of accessing content by caching it at globally distributed edge locations, reducing latency. It integrates with various AWS services as origins and allows flexible configuration through distributions and behaviors. The lesson also previews creating a web distribution in CloudFront and configuring caching behaviors for different S3 origins.

   - Allows setting start and expiration times, and restricts access to specific IP addresses or ranges.
   - Used for individual files and clients that don't support cookies.
   - Example: A client authenticates via a serverless application, receives a signed URL, and uses it to access content on CloudFront.

2. **Signed Cookies:**
   - Similar to signed URLs but used when URLs shouldn't be changed.
   - Suitable for providing access to multiple restricted files.
![image](https://github.com/Mohanakri/AWS_SOA-Admin/assets/96922237/e48c60bf-7f8d-4b99-b46d-7219f283ae9d)
![image](https://github.com/Mohanakri/AWS_SOA-Admin/assets/96922237/fdf1fe54-e9d6-4711-83e4-ad442d813bf2)

3. **Origin Access Identity (OAI):**
   - A legacy feature for restricting access to S3 content so it must be accessed via CloudFront.
   - Involves creating an OAI in CloudFront and specifying it in the S3 bucket policy.
   - Ensures users can't access the S3 bucket directly, only through CloudFront.
   - Example: An S3 bucket configured as a static website, accessed via CloudFront with OAI specified in the bucket policy.

4. **Origin Access Control (OAC):**
   - The recommended replacement for OAI, supporting additional use cases.
   - Used when connecting to all S3 buckets in all regions, using S3 server-side encryption with AWS KMS keys, and handling dynamic requests (PUT and DELETE).
   - Requires an S3 bucket policy allowing CloudFront service principals.
   - Similar setup to OAI but with expanded capabilities and use cases.

### Summary:
CloudFront provides multiple ways to control access to content through signed URLs and cookies, OAI, and the newer OAC. Signed URLs and cookies manage access based on URLs and cookies, while OAI and OAC restrict direct S3 bucket access, ensuring content is accessed through CloudFront. OAC is the preferred method due to its support for more complex use cases and broader regional and encryption support.

# 13.AWS WAF

AWS Web Application Firewall (WAF) is a security service that allows you to create rules called web ACLs (Access Control Lists) to filter traffic based on various conditions such as IP addresses, HTTP headers, body content, custom URIs, and geographic location. It is effective in protecting against common web exploits like SQL injection and cross-site scripting.

**Key Points:**

- **Use Cases:** WAF can protect resources behind Application Load Balancers (ALB), CloudFront distributions, API Gateways, and AWS AppSync.
- **Web ACLs:** These are used to protect a set of resources. Within a web ACL, you create rules that define what to inspect and the action to take if a request meets the criteria.
- **Rule Groups:** Rules can be grouped together for easier management.
- **IP Sets:** Collections of IP addresses and ranges used in rule statements to allow or block traffic from specific IPs.
- **Regex Pattern Set:** Collections of regular expressions used in rule statements.
- **Rule Actions:** WAF can count, allow, or block requests based on the rules. Blocking results in a 403 forbidden status code.
- **Match Statements:** These compare web requests or their origin against specified conditions.
- **Match Options:** Include geographic match, IP Set match, Regex, size constraints, SQLi attacks, string matches, and cross-site scripting attacks.

**Visual Use Cases:**
- WAF can be placed in front of CloudFront distributions, ALBs, API Gateways, and AppSync to protect the applications running behind them from various types of web attacks.

**Exam Tips:**
- Remember keywords like common web exploits, SQL injection, and cross-site scripting.
- Recognize the use cases for resources behind ALB, CloudFront, or API Gateway.

In summary, AWS WAF is a comprehensive tool for filtering and protecting web traffic, allowing you to define detailed rules and actions to mitigate various security threats effectively.

# 15.WAF Web ACL For CloudFront:Hands_ON

In this lesson, you will learn how to create an AWS WAF Web ACL for a CloudFront distribution. Follow these steps to set it up:

1. **Prerequisites:**
   - Ensure your CloudFront distribution is running with an alternate domain name and an ACM certificate for secure access.

2. **Create Web ACL:**
   - Log in to AWS WAF and click on "Create web ACL."
   - Set the resource type to "Amazon CloudFront distributions," add your distribution, and name the Web ACL (e.g., "rate 100").
   - Add rules using the rule builder, choose a rate-based rule, and set the rate limit (e.g., 100 requests per IP in 5 minutes). The default action is to block.

3. **Deploy and Test:**
   - Create the Web ACL and associate it with your distribution.
   - Wait for the distribution to deploy (status will change to "deploying" and then "enabled").
   - Use AWS CloudShell to test the rate limit by running a command to make 140 connection attempts to the CloudFront distribution. Substitute your domain name in the command.

4. **Monitor and Verify:**
   - Monitor the connection attempts. After exceeding the rate limit, connection attempts will be blocked, and you'll see request block messages.

5. **Clean Up:**
   - To dismantle the setup:
     - Disable the CloudFront distribution.
     - Delete the distribution once itâ€™s disabled.
     - Delete the Web ACL.
     - Optionally, delete the ACM certificate and Route 53 A record if no longer needed.

Following this process ensures your CloudFront distribution is protected by AWS WAF with rate-based rules, and you can efficiently manage and clean up resources afterward.
