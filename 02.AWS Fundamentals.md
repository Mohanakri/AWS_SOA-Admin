# 1.Amazon Virtual Pravite Cloud(VPC)

In this lesson, you'll learn about Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). Here's a summary of the key points:

1. **VPC Basics**:
   - VPCs are created within an AWS region and provide a logically isolated portion of the cloud.
   - VPCs utilize availability zones (AZs) for creating subnets.
   - Subnets are always within a single AZ and cannot span across multiple AZs.
   - Instances are launched into VPC subnets.

2. **Internet Access**:
   - To access the internet, an internet gateway must be attached to the VPC.
   - A router within the VPC handles internal and external traffic routing.
   - Routes are configured via the main route table.
   - Example: Traffic within the VPC CIDR block is routed locally, while other traffic is routed through the internet gateway.

3. **VPC and Subnets**:
   - Multiple VPCs can exist within each AWS region, each with a unique CIDR block.
   - Subnets are created with smaller address blocks within the VPC's CIDR range.
   - Understanding subnetting is crucial for VPC configuration.
   ![image](https://github.com/Mohanakri/AWS_SOA-Admin/assets/96922237/55f5870d-ab8c-435a-8084-36dc08b53802)

4. **Public and Private Services and Endpoints**:
   - Public services (e.g., Amazon S3) are outside the VPC, while private services operate within the VPC.
   - Instances in public subnets can connect to the internet, while instances in private subnets cannot.
   - VPC endpoints enable private connections to public services, avoiding internet traffic.
   - API access can be made using public endpoints for both public and private services.
![image](https://github.com/Mohanakri/AWS_SOA-Admin/assets/96922237/9080104b-273a-4efd-8f93-1d8b7caba2b9)

5. **Connecting to Services**:
   - Public subnets use public IPs for internet access.
   - Private subnets use private IPs and require connections through public subnets or VPC endpoints for internet access.
   - Programmatic access to AWS services uses public endpoints.

6. **Network Access**:
   - Direct internet connections are possible to instances in public subnets.
   - Private subnet instances can be accessed from within the VPC but not directly from the internet.
   - Connections between public and private subnets within the VPC are possible.

This lesson is foundational for understanding and working with VPCs, which will be further explored in subsequent lessons.

===================================================================================

# 2.AWS Virtual Pravite Network(VPN):Hands_ON

1. **VPC Configuration**:
   - Create a VPC named "my VPC" with a specified CIDR block.
   - Use two availability zones (AZs) in the US East region (1A and 1B).
   - Create one public and one private subnet in each AZ, each with its own CIDR block.
   - Set up two route tables: a main route table for public subnets (with a route to an Internet gateway) and a private route table.

2. **AWS Management Console**:
   - Navigate to the VPC management console and ensure you are in the US East (North Virginia) region.
   - Note the default VPC and its subnets, route tables, and Internet gateway.

3. **Creating the Custom VPC**:
   - Download the necessary values from the course materials.
   - Create the VPC using the "VPC only" option.
   - Define the CIDR block and other settings.
   - Create subnets for the VPC and associate them with the appropriate AZs and CIDR blocks.

4. **Subnets and Public IPs**:
   - Enable auto-assign public IPv4 addresses for the public subnets.
   - Create an Internet gateway, attach it to the VPC, and update the main route table to include a route to the Internet gateway.

5. **Private Route Table**:
   - Create a private route table and associate it with the private subnets.
   - Verify that the public subnets are associated with the main route table and the private subnets with the private route table.

6. **NAT Gateway for Private Subnets**:
   - Create a NAT gateway in a public subnet to enable Internet access for instances in the private subnets.
   - Update the private route table to route traffic through the NAT gateway.
   - Optionally, delete the NAT gateway and release the associated Elastic IP to avoid charges.

7. **Final Configuration**:
   - Confirm that the VPC is set up correctly with public and private subnets.
   - Ensure that instances in public subnets can access the Internet and those in private subnets can access the Internet via the NAT gateway.
   - The custom VPC can now be used without incurring additional costs, except for the NAT gateway if it remains active.

This lesson provides a comprehensive guide to setting up a custom VPC in AWS, including creating subnets, configuring route tables, and setting up Internet access for both public and private subnets.

================================================================================
# 3.Security Group & Network ACL's


In this lesson, you will learn about security groups and network ACLs (network access control lists or NACLs) in AWS, and the difference between stateful and stateless firewalls. Here's a summary:

1. **Stateful vs. Stateless Firewalls**:
   - **Stateful Firewall**: Allows return traffic automatically if the inbound traffic is allowed. Only one rule is required.
   - **Stateless Firewall**: Requires rules for both inbound and outbound traffic. Both directions need explicit rules.
![image](https://github.com/Mohanakri/AWS_SOA-Admin/assets/96922237/fd61ab9d-818d-433d-91e9-ff15929421be)

2. **Security Groups**:
   - **Stateful**: Operate at the instance (or interface) level.
   - **Allow Rules Only**: No traffic is allowed unless explicitly allowed by a rule.
   - **Instance Level**: Applied to instances and affect traffic between instances within and across subnets.
   - **Evaluation**: All rules are evaluated, and they apply to an instance if associated with the security group.

3. **Network ACLs**:
   - **Stateless**: Operate at the subnet level.
   - **Allow and Deny Rules**: Can explicitly allow or deny traffic.
   - **Order of Rules**: Rules are processed in order, and the first matching rule (allow or deny) is applied.
   - **Subnet Level**: Applied to all instances within the associated subnet and check both outbound and inbound traffic.
![image](https://github.com/Mohanakri/AWS_SOA-Admin/assets/96922237/d214faa2-5a32-4806-bce3-d493285787b1)

4. **Practical Application**:
   - **Security Groups**: Can be used across different subnets and apply to specific instances, affecting instance-level traffic.
   - **Network ACLs**: Applied to subnets and control traffic entering or exiting the subnet, affecting all instances within the subnet.
![image](https://github.com/Mohanakri/AWS_SOA-Admin/assets/96922237/00b5b8c3-87a5-4de2-afad-ee43ce2f29f1)

===============================================================================
# 4.Security Group:Hands_ON

In this lesson, you will learn how to create and manage security groups in AWS through the management console for your custom VPC.

1. **Navigating to Security Groups**:
   - Access security groups from the VPC dashboard under the security section or from the EC2 management console.

2. **Default Security Groups**:
   - Default VPC security groups allow all traffic within the same security group without restrictions on protocols or port ranges.
   - Outbound rules allow all traffic to any destination.

3. **Creating a Custom Security Group**:
   - Click on "Create Security Group" and name it (e.g., "Web access").
   - Select your custom VPC instead of the default VPC.
   - By default, an outbound rule allowing all traffic to any destination is created.

4. **Adding Inbound Rules**:
   - Add rules for secure Shell (SSH) on port 22, RDP on port 3389, and HTTP on port 80.
   - For best security practices, specify source IPs or ranges, but for testing, you may open it to any source.
   
5. **Summary**:
   - SSH allows secure management of instances.
   - RDP is for managing Windows instances.
   - HTTP enables running web servers.
   - Apply the security group to instances in your custom VPC to use these protocols.

6. **Final Steps**:
   - Create the security group and review the inbound and outbound rules.

This setup allows managing instances securely and running web servers while ensuring proper traffic control through security group rules.

# 12.Working With Objects on S3:Hands_ON

This lesson covers working with objects in Amazon S3 using both the S3 management console and the REST API. It explains how developers can interact with S3 via code using HTTP methods like GET (for downloading) and PUT (for uploading). The instructor demonstrates how to create a unique, globally-named S3 bucket in a specific region using the S3 management console, upload a file, and view its object URL and key. It is noted that objects are not publicly accessible by default but can be made public using access control lists or bucket policies.

The lesson then shifts to using the AWS CLI and CloudShell to interact with S3. It demonstrates uploading a file via the command line, checking the file system, and verifying the upload in the S3 console. The instructor shows how to download a file using the S3 API, emphasizing the importance of correct paths and object keys. Additionally, the lesson includes creating and using pre-signed URLs for downloading objects.

Finally, the instructor demonstrates cleaning up by deleting the bucket and its contents using the AWS CLI, ensuring the bucket and its objects are removed from the S3 management console. This lesson provides a comprehensive overview of managing S3 objects through both graphical and command-line interfaces.

# 13.AWS Database:RDS,Aurora & ElastiCache

In this lesson, the focus is on three AWS database services: Amazon RDS, Aurora, and ElastiCache.

1. **Amazon RDS**:
   - Managed relational database service running on EC2 instances.
   - Supports engines like Aurora, MySQL, MariaDB, Oracle, SQL Server, and PostgreSQL.
   - Used for online transaction processing (OLTP) with high availability, fault tolerance, and scalability.
   - Databases can be encrypted using AWS KMS.
   - Scaling is primarily vertical (changing instance type) but can also be horizontal for read traffic.

3. **ElastiCache**:
   - Fully managed in-memory data store supporting Redis and Memcached.
   - Provides high performance and low latency, often used in front of databases like RDS or DynamoDB.
   - Runs on EC2 instances with selectable instance types.
   - Key-value store suitable for caching frequently accessed data.
   - Redis offers more complex features like data persistence, complex data types, and multi-AZ replication.
   - Memcached is simpler with no data persistence and no encryption.
   - Use cases include session storage, database caching, leaderboards, and streaming data dashboards.

# 14.Amazon RDS Security

This lesson covers the security aspects of Amazon RDS:

1. **Running RDS Databases in a VPC**:
   - RDS databases are assigned an IP address within a VPC.
   - Databases can be made publicly accessible or kept private within the VPC.
![image](https://github.com/Mohanakri/AWS_SOA-Admin/assets/96922237/f5ae387a-2d92-4737-a2f7-1056b876fa22)

2. **Security Groups**:
   - Separate security groups should be used for RDS databases and EC2 instances/applications.
   - Rules should be created to allow application security groups to access the RDS database on the relevant port (e.g., port 3306 for MySQL).
![image](https://github.com/Mohanakri/AWS_SOA-Admin/assets/96922237/380d839f-ffac-4c4a-813f-a6c59755ee07)

3. **Encryption**:
   - **Encryption in Transit**: SSL/TLS can be enabled for secure connections between the application and the database.
   - **Encryption at Rest**: RDS encryption uses AES 256-bit encryption for database volumes, backups, read replicas, and snapshots. This must be enabled at database creation and cannot be changed afterward.
   - AWS Key Management Service (KMS) is used for managing encryption keys.

4. **Key Exam Tips**:
   - Encrypted and unencrypted statuses must match between primary and read replicas.
   - Restoring backups or snapshots to a DB instance maintains the original encryption status.
   - To change the encryption status of a database, create a new encrypted snapshot from an unencrypted database, then create a new RDS instance from that encrypted snapshot. This will require updating application endpoints to point to the new encrypted database.

5. **Upcoming Hands-on Lesson**:
   - The next lesson will include a hands-on demonstration of how to encrypt snapshots and create a database from them.

============================================================================
# 15.Create & Manage RDS:Hands_ON

In this hands-on lesson, the process of creating and managing an RDS database is demonstrated. Here's a summary of the key steps and concepts covered:

1. **Creating an RDS Database**:
   - Navigate to RDS in the AWS Management Console and select "Create a database."
   - Choose the standard create option, select MySQL, and opt for the free tier.
   - Provide a database name (e.g., sample-DB), username (default is admin), and a password.
   - Adjust the DB instance class and storage as needed, then proceed to create the database.

2. **Database Configuration**:
   - Once the database is active, note the endpoint and port number (e.g., MySQL uses port 3306).
   - Verify the VPC, AZ, subnets, and security groups. Ensure security groups allow access on the relevant port from your EC2 instances.

3. **Monitoring and Logs**:
   - Monitor metrics such as CPU usage, database connections, storage, and latency through the RDS console.
   - Enhanced monitoring can be enabled for more detailed metrics if supported by the instance type.
   - Check logs and events, create CloudWatch alarms, and view or download error logs.

4. **Configuration Management**:
   - Review configuration settings and modify them if necessary.
   - Automated backups are enabled by default with a 7-day retention period. Manual snapshots can be taken anytime.

5. **Advanced Actions**:
   - Actions available include converting to multi-AZ, stopping, rebooting, deleting the database, setting up connections to EC2, creating read replicas, and performing blue-green deployments.
   - Read replicas can be created in the same or different regions with customizable settings.

6. **Database Deletion**:
   - When deleting the database, you have options to create a final snapshot and retain automated backups. Acknowledge the deletion and type "delete me" to confirm.

7. **Exam Preparation**:
   - This lesson is part of the preparation for the AWS Certified SysOps Administrator – Associate certification exam.

By following these steps, you can effectively create, configure, monitor, and manage an RDS database in AWS.

# 16.AWS Shared Responsible Model

AWS Shared Responsibility Model
Security and Compliance is a shared responsibility between AWS and the customer. This shared model can help relieve the customer’s operational burden as AWS operates, manages and controls the components from the host operating system and virtualization layer down to the physical security of the facilities in which the service operates. The customer assumes responsibility and management of the guest operating system (including updates and security patches), other associated application software as well as the configuration of the AWS provided security group firewall. Customers should carefully consider the services they choose as their responsibilities vary depending on the services used, the integration of those services into their IT environment, and applicable laws and regulations. The nature of this shared responsibility also provides the flexibility and customer control that permits the deployment. As shown in the chart below, this differentiation of responsibility is commonly referred to as Security “of” the Cloud versus Security “in” the Cloud.

AWS responsibility “Security of the Cloud” - AWS is responsible for protecting the infrastructure that runs all of the services offered in the AWS Cloud. This infrastructure is composed of the hardware, software, networking, and facilities that run AWS Cloud services.

Customer responsibility “Security in the Cloud” – Customer responsibility will be determined by the AWS Cloud services that a customer selects. This determines the amount of configuration work the customer must perform as part of their security responsibilities. For example, a service such as Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) is categorized as Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) and, as such, requires the customer to perform all of the necessary security configuration and management tasks. Customers that deploy an Amazon EC2 instance are responsible for management of the guest operating system (including updates and security patches), any application software or utilities installed by the customer on the instances, and the configuration of the AWS-provided firewall (called a security group) on each instance. For abstracted services, such as Amazon S3 and Amazon DynamoDB, AWS operates the infrastructure layer, the operating system, and platforms, and customers access the endpoints to store and retrieve data. Customers are responsible for managing their data (including encryption options), classifying their assets, and using IAM tools to apply the appropriate permissions.

This customer/AWS shared responsibility model also extends to IT controls. Just as the responsibility to operate the IT environment is shared between AWS and its customers, so is the management, operation and verification of IT controls shared. AWS can help relieve customer burden of operating controls by managing those controls associated with the physical infrastructure deployed in the AWS environment that may previously have been managed by the customer. As every customer is deployed differently in AWS, customers can take advantage of shifting management of certain IT controls to AWS which results in a (new) distributed control environment. Customers can then use the AWS control and compliance documentation available to them to perform their control evaluation and verification procedures as required. Below are examples of controls that are managed by AWS, AWS Customers and/or both.

Inherited Controls – Controls which a customer fully inherits from AWS.

Physical and Environmental controls

Shared Controls – Controls which apply to both the infrastructure layer and customer layers, but in completely separate contexts or perspectives. In a shared control, AWS provides the requirements for the infrastructure and the customer must provide their own control implementation within their use of AWS services. Examples include:

Patch Management – AWS is responsible for patching and fixing flaws within the infrastructure, but customers are responsible for patching their guest OS and applications.

Configuration Management – AWS maintains the configuration of its infrastructure devices, but a customer is responsible for configuring their own guest operating systems, databases, and applications.

Awareness & Training - AWS trains AWS employees, but a customer must train their own employees.

Customer Specific – Controls which are solely the responsibility of the customer based on the application they are deploying within AWS services. Examples include:

Service and Communications Protection or Zone Security which may require a customer to route or zone data within specific security environments.
