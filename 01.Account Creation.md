The lesson covers configuring an AWS account to manage billing and avoid unexpected charges. Here are the key steps:

1. **Configure an Account Alias**: Create an alias for your AWS account to simplify the sign-in process instead of using the account ID.

2. **Enable Billing Access for IAM Users**: Allow IAM users to access billing information, which is a best practice instead of using the root user account.

3. **Update Billing Preferences**: 
   - Opt to receive PDF invoices via email.
   - Set up alerts for free tier usage limits.
   - Enable billing alerts and provide an email address for notifications.

4. **Create a Budget and Alarm**: 
   - Set a budget (e.g., $5 or $10) to monitor expenses.
   - Configure email notifications to alert when approaching or exceeding the budget, safeguarding against accidental charges.

These steps ensure effective billing management and help prevent unexpected costs by keeping track of usage and setting up alerts.
