# 1.Elasticity:Scaling Up vs Out
In this lesson, the focus is on understanding the differences between scaling up and scaling out, key concepts related to elasticity and scalability in cloud computing.

**Scalability vs. Elasticity**:
- **Scalability**: Adding more resources. Example: Adding another hard drive to a computer.
- **Elasticity**: Automatically adjusting resources based on demand. Example: Scaling resources up when needed and shrinking back when not in use.

**Scaling Up (Vertical Scaling)**:
- Involves adding more resources (CPU, memory, storage) to a single instance.
- Example: Upgrading an EC2 instance from a t2.micro (1 vCPU, 1 GB RAM) to a c5.xlarge (4 vCPUs, 8 GB RAM).
- Limitation: Single point of failureâ€”if the instance fails, all resources and applications on it are affected.
![image](https://github.com/Mohanakri/AWS_SOA-Admin/assets/96922237/ebd35e10-a005-4e0b-80a9-2a17588ce694)

**Scaling Out (Horizontal Scaling)**:
- Involves adding more instances of an application.
- Example: Adding multiple t2.micro instances to handle increased demand.
- Benefits: Increased resiliency and nearly unlimited capacity. If one instance fails, others can take over the load.
 ![image](https://github.com/Mohanakri/AWS_SOA-Admin/assets/96922237/a4ae48ad-9d10-46ac-ac37-3ad0f6d65807)
 
**Cloud Benefits**:
- Only pay for what you use, avoiding the fixed costs associated with on-premises infrastructure.
- Automatic scaling up and out, and back in again, based on demand.

**Example with Amazon EC2**:
- **Vertical Scaling**: Changing the instance type to one with more resources.
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Adding more instances of the same type to increase capacity.

**Upcoming Lesson**:
- Introduction to Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling, which automates the process of launching and terminating instances to manage scaling based on demand.
============================================================================================

### Additional Scaling Settings:
- **Cooldown**: Prevents new scaling actions until the effects of previous actions are visible (default five minutes).
- **Termination Policies**: Defines which instances to terminate first during a scale-in event.
- **Termination Protection**: Prevents certain instances from being terminated by the ASG.
- **Standby State**: Allows instances to be paused for troubleshooting without triggering scaling actions.
- **Lifecycle Hooks**: Pauses instances during launch or termination to perform custom actions, such as running scripts or processing data.

This lesson provides a comprehensive understanding of how AWS Auto Scaling works, its integration with CloudWatch, and the various scaling policies and settings that can be configured to manage resources efficiently.
===========================================================================================
# 3.Amazon Elastic Load Balancing 

The transcript explains Amazon Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) and its operation in distributing traffic across instances. Here are the key points:
![image](https://github.com/Mohanakri/AWS_SOA-Admin/assets/96922237/c1f55a95-4b83-4f32-9946-febe323d4f93)
![image](https://github.com/Mohanakri/AWS_SOA-Admin/assets/96922237/618d7941-cc62-486e-8146-9f7115a97108)

- **ELB Basics**: ELB sits in front of an Auto Scaling group to evenly distribute traffic across instances.
- **Traffic Distribution**: Users connect to a single application endpoint managed by ELB, which directs traffic to instances based on health and availability.
- **Handling Failures**: If an instance fails, ELB redirects traffic to healthy instances automatically.
- **Types of ELB**: Focuses on Application Load Balancer (ALB) and Network Load Balancer (NLB).
  - **ALB**: Operates at Layer 7 (application layer), uses HTTP/HTTPS, and supports advanced routing based on HTTP headers (path, host, query string, source IP).
  - **NLB**: Operates at Layer 4 (connection level), supports TCP/UDP, and is ideal for low-latency, high-throughput applications and static IP addresses.
![image](https://github.com/Mohanakri/AWS_SOA-Admin/assets/96922237/f6428dee-e0fe-4384-8ad6-bdbfb33f26d1)

- **Use Cases**:
  - **ALB**: Best for web applications, microservices, Docker containers, and AWS Lambda functions.
  - **NLB**: Suitable for TCP/UDP-based applications, requiring ultra-low latency, high throughput, and static IP addresses.
![image](https://github.com/Mohanakri/AWS_SOA-Admin/assets/96922237/d182e80c-c66e-4a27-8038-d63c88d912a7)


These load balancers help in maintaining application availability, scalability, and fault tolerance by intelligently routing traffic across multiple instances.
==========================================================================================
# 4.Create a ASG & ALB with CLI:Hands_ON
In this lesson, the instructor demonstrates how to create an Auto Scaling Group (ASG) and an Application Load Balancer (ALB) using the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI). Here's a summary of the key steps and actions:

1. **Creating a Security Group**:
   - A security group named "ALB_EC2Access" is created in the US East 1 region.
   - Ingress rules are configured to allow access from any source to ports 22 (SSH) and 80 (HTTP).

2. **Creating a Launch Template**:
   - A launch template named "LT1" is created specifying Amazon Linux 2 as the OS image and t2.micro as the instance type.
   - User data is included to update, install Apache (HTTPD), and display the instance's availability zone on a webpage.

3. **Creating an Auto Scaling Group (ASG)**:
   - Using the AWS CLI command `aws autoscaling create-auto-scaling-group`, an ASG named "ASG1" is created.
   - The launch template "LT1" is referenced, and configurations are set for min size 1, max size 3, and desired capacity 2.
   - Subnet IDs for availability zones (us-east-1a and us-east-1b) are specified.

4. **Creating a Target Group**:
   - A target group named "TG1" is created within the default VPC using the VPC ID obtained earlier.

5. **Creating a Load Balancer**:
   - An ALB is created using the AWS CLI command `aws elbv2 create-load-balancer`.
   - Subnet IDs (us-east-1a and us-east-1b) and the security group ID are specified.
   - The ALB is configured to be publicly accessible and the ARN (Amazon Resource Name) is copied for future use.

6. **Configuring a Listener**:
   - A listener is added to the ALB using the AWS CLI command `aws elbv2 create-listener`.
   - It listens on port 80 (HTTP) and forwards traffic to target group "TG1".

7. **Attaching the Load Balancer to the Auto Scaling Group**:
   - The ALB is attached to the ASG using the AWS CLI command `aws autoscaling attach-load-balancer-target-groups`.
   - This ensures that the instances launched by the ASG are registered with the ALB for load balancing.

8. **Verification**:
   - Instances launched by the ASG are checked in the EC2 console and confirmed to be running.
   - The target group's health checks confirm instances are healthy and serving requests.
   - The ALB's DNS name is tested to ensure it properly distributes traffic across instances in different availability zones.

By following these steps, the instructor demonstrates how to set up a scalable and highly available web application environment using AWS services managed through the CLI.
======================================================================================
# 5.Create a Life Cycle Hook:Hands_ON

In this hands-on lesson, the instructor guides through setting up a lifecycle hook for an EC2 instance within an Auto Scaling Group (ASG). Here's a summary of the steps and actions taken:

1. **Preparation**:
   - Ensure an Auto Scaling Group (ASG) and an Application Load Balancer (ALB) are previously created.

2. **Creating a Lifecycle Hook**:
   - Navigate to the AWS Management Console to configure a lifecycle hook through the AWS CLI.
   - A topic is created in Amazon SNS to trigger notifications upon instance termination events.
   - The SNS topic ARN is copied for use in configuring the lifecycle hook.

3. **IAM Role Configuration**:
   - Update an IAM role to grant permissions necessary for the lifecycle hook, specifically allowing actions related to EC2, SNS, and CloudWatch.

4. **Lambda Function Setup**:
   - Create a Lambda function named "Lambda-lifecycle" using Python 3.7 runtime.
   - Attach an IAM role ("Lambda-lifecycle") to the Lambda function, granting necessary permissions.
   - Replace the function code with Python script (`Lambda-lifecycle-action.py`) provided in the course materials.
   - Subscribe the Lambda function to the SNS topic to receive termination event notifications.

5. **Testing the Setup**:
   - Verify the Lambda function trigger by changing the desired capacity of the ASG to zero, initiating instance termination.
   - Monitor CloudWatch logs for Lambda execution details and ensure snapshots of EC2 instances are created as expected.
   - Validate that snapshots are successfully completed.

6. **Cleanup**:
   - Terminate the ASG and ALB using AWS CLI commands.
   - Manually delete any snapshots created during testing to ensure complete cleanup.

By following these steps, the setup ensures that upon instance termination within the ASG, a snapshot of the EC2 instance's root volume is automatically taken, providing data preservation during scaling operations. The process involves configuring AWS resources, managing IAM roles, setting up Lambda functions, testing functionality, and performing cleanup post-experimentation.
===========================================================================
# 6.Session State & Session Stickiness

In this lesson, the instructor discusses strategies for managing session state data in applications deployed using Elastic Load Balancers (ELB) and EC2 instances:

1. **Statelessness and Session Data**:
   - Applications on EC2 instances are typically stateless, meaning they don't store persistent data locally due to instance termination and replacement.
   - Session state data, such as authentication credentials, needs to be stored externally to ensure continuity across instance changes.
![image](https://github.com/Mohanakri/AWS_SOA-Admin/assets/96922237/f48c685f-b958-4cc3-81a1-8e236fd6bae6)
![image](https://github.com/Mohanakri/AWS_SOA-Admin/assets/96922237/21769fbb-b0bd-47f5-9e97-b13b6b9de851)

2. **Techniques for Session State Management**:
   - **External Storage**: Session data can be stored in external services like DynamoDB. This allows users to maintain their authentication credentials even if redirected to a new EC2 instance.
   - **Elasticache**: Another option for storing session data, providing low-latency access suitable for caching needs.
   - **Amazon S3**: In some cases, S3 can also be used for session data storage.
![image](https://github.com/Mohanakri/AWS_SOA-Admin/assets/96922237/a0985a46-222e-45a6-884b-f89c0d4aedca)

3. **Sticky Sessions**:
   - **Definition**: Sticky sessions bind a user's session to a specific EC2 instance for the duration of a cookie's lifetime.
   - **Usage**: Useful when some session data can be stored locally on the instance, though it poses risks if the instance fails because session data may be lost.
   - **Combination with External Storage**: Sticky sessions can be used in conjunction with external stores for session state data, balancing local storage efficiency with external data persistence.

4. **Considerations**:
   - **Latency**: External stores may introduce latency compared to local storage, which needs consideration depending on application requirements.
   - **Usability**: Ensuring users don't have to re-authenticate when redirected to a new instance enhances usability and user experience.

These strategies ensure that applications using ELB and EC2 instances can efficiently manage session state data, maintaining user sessions seamlessly across instance changes while balancing between local and external storage options based on specific application needs and performance considerations.
========================================================================================
# 7.Amazon RDS Backup & Recovery

1. **RPO (Recovery Point Objective)**:
   - Defines the acceptable amount of data loss in case of a disaster.
   - Measured in seconds, minutes, or hours.
   - Example: A 2-hour RPO means data backups must be taken every 2 hours, risking up to 2 hours of data loss.

2. **RTO (Recovery Time Objective)**:
   - Measures how long it takes to restore systems after a disaster.
   - Also measured in seconds, minutes, or hours.
   - Example: A 4-hour RTO means systems are expected to be back online within 4 hours after a disaster.

4. **Techniques to Achieve Low RPO and RTO**:
   - **Synchronous Replication**: Ensures data is replicated instantly across locations, suitable for milliseconds and seconds RPO.
   - **Asynchronous Replication**: Delays data replication slightly, allowing replication over longer distances, suitable for seconds to minutes RPO.
   - **Snapshots**: Taken at intervals (minutes to hours range) to back up instances or databases, used in cloud environments like AWS S3.

5. **Disaster Recovery Strategies**:
   - **Backup and Restore**: Low-cost strategy where data is backed up and restored to alternate locations after a disaster.
   - **Pilot Light**: Minimal setup with critical components running in standby mode, ready to scale up in case of a disaster.
   - **Warm Standby**: Similar to Pilot Light but with some application components running actively in addition to critical services.
   - **Multi-Site Active-Active**: Highest cost strategy ensuring zero downtime and minimal data loss, with active systems in multiple regions or data centers.

6. **AWS Specific Considerations**:
   - **AWS Multi-Region Deployments**: Utilizes Route 53 for active-active load balancing across regions.
   - **DynamoDB Global Tables**: Supports active-active replication for databases across regions, though with some replication lag.

7. **Cost Considerations**: 
   - Higher levels of resilience and lower RPO/RTO come with increased infrastructure and operational costs.

8. **Conclusion**:
   - Understanding RPO, RTO, and various disaster recovery strategies is crucial for designing resilient and reliable IT systems.
   - Recommended further reading includes detailed AWS documentation on disaster recovery strategies and implementations.

This overview highlights the importance of planning and implementing effective disaster recovery strategies based on business needs, infrastructure capabilities, and cost considerations.

# 13.Implement EBS Volume Life Cycle:Hands_ON

Here's a summary of the transcript:

In this tutorial, the focus is on creating a policy for EBS volume lifecycle using the Data Lifecycle Management service in the EC2 Management Console.

1. **Launching an EC2 Instance**:
   - The instructor uses a launch template (LT1) to quickly launch an EC2 instance. The instance is configured with basic settings and tags.

2. **Tagging the Instance**:
   - A specific tag is added to the EC2 instance that will be used by Data Lifecycle Manager. The tag used is "backup: yes".

3. **Configuring Data Lifecycle Manager**:
   - Navigate to the Elastic Block Store section in the EC2 Management Console.
   - Access the Data Lifecycle Manager to create an EBS snapshot policy.
   - Choose "Instance" as the target resource and specify the tag "backup: yes" to target instances with that tag.

4. **Policy Configuration**:
   - Provide a description for the policy (e.g., "My daily backup").
   - Choose the default role option for policy execution.
   - Configure the snapshot schedule to run daily, starting at a specified time (e.g., 9 UTC).
   - Select the retention type, either based on count (number of snapshots) or age (duration).

5. **Review and Creation**:
   - Review the configured policy details.
   - Confirm the settings and create the policy.
   - Once created, the policy will automatically create snapshots of the specified EC2 instances' volumes according to the defined schedule.

6. **Outcome**:
   - The instructor notes that snapshots will be created every 24 hours based on the policy settings.
   - It may take some time before the snapshots appear in the console, depending on the schedule configured.

This tutorial demonstrates how to effectively use AWS Data Lifecycle Manager to automate the creation and management of EBS volume snapshots based on defined policies, ensuring regular data backups according to specified retention rules.
