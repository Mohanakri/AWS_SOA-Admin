3. **Example Dashboard:**
   - Displays a summary of EC2 instances, showing 61% are over-provisioned (excess resources, wasting money) and some are under-provisioned (lacking resources).
   - Provides a breakdown of instance statuses: over-provisioned, under-provisioned, and optimized.

4. **Recommendations:**
   - Shows specific EC2 instance recommendations, including instance IDs, findings (e.g., over-provisioned), current instance type, recommended instance type, and potential cost savings.
   - Example: Recommending a move from a c5.xlarge instance to a t3.large instance to save costs.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - AWS Compute Optimizer is straightforward and helps in recommending the best resource configurations for instances, EBS volumes, and Lambda functions to optimize costs and performance.

# 2.Cost Allocatio Tags:Hands_ON

This lesson covers how to use cost allocation tags in AWS to organize resources and track costs.

**What are Cost Allocation Tags?**
- Tags used to organize resources and identify associated costs.
- Enabled in the billing and cost management console for reporting, such as in the cost and usage report.
- Useful for understanding resource costs based on tag structures (e.g., departments).

**Steps to Use Cost Allocation Tags:**
1. **Navigate to Cost Allocation Tags:**
   - Access the billing dashboard on AWS.
   - Go to cost allocation tags.

2. **AWS-Generated Tags:**
   - Pre-configured tags provided by AWS.
   - Enable tags such as "created by" to attribute resource costs to the user who launched them.

3. **User-Defined Tags:**
   - Create and assign custom tags to resources (e.g., "department").
   - Enable these tags in the cost allocation tags section.

4. **Viewing Costs in Cost Explorer:**
   - Go to Cost Explorer to view cost information.
   - Filter costs by tags such as "department" or "created by."
   - Example: A resource tagged with "department: operations" shows costs associated with that department.

5. **Example:**
   - An EC2 instance tagged with "department: operations" is visible in Cost Explorer, showing costs for that department.
   - Another filter example: "created by" shows costs attributed to specific users or roles.

In summary, cost allocation tags help you understand and manage resource costs by allowing you to attribute costs to specific tags like departments or users.

3. **Price List API:**
   - Allows querying the prices of AWS services.
   - Two components: 
     - **Price List Service API (Query API):** Uses JSON for queries.
     - **Bulk API:** Uses HTML for queries.
   - Supports sending alerts via SNS when prices change, useful for monitoring and notifications.

These tools and APIs provide comprehensive capabilities to manage and optimize AWS costs effectively.

1. **On-Demand Pricing**: Standard rate, no commitment. Ideal for development, testing, and unpredictable workloads.
2. **Reserved Instances**: One- or three-year commitments with up to 75% discounts. Suitable for steady-state, predictable workloads, and capacity reservations.
3. **Spot Instances**: Up to 90% discounts for unused capacity, but instances can be terminated by AWS at any time. Best for low-cost compute needs.
4. **Dedicated Instances**: Physical isolation at the hardware level, billed per instance.
5. **Dedicated Hosts**: Dedicated physical server with visibility into sockets and cores, billed per host. Useful for server-bound software licenses.
6. **Savings Plans**: Commit to a consistent amount of usage for one or three years for EC2, Fargate, or Lambda, and pay by the hour.
   
Billing methods include per-second with a minimum charge of one minute (applicable to Amazon Linux, Windows, and Ubuntu in various forms) and per-hour billing for commercial Linux distros like Red Hat and SuSE. 

**Reserved Instances** can be standard or convertible, with flexible options to modify instance attributes. Payment can be all upfront, partial upfront, or no upfront, affecting the discount received.

**On-Demand Capacity Reservations** allow reserving compute capacity in specific availability zones with no term commitments, cancelable at any time.

**Spot Instances** can be part of spot fleets or EC2 fleets, which combine spot and on-demand instances to meet capacity targets. Spot instances come with a two-minute warning before AWS reclaims capacity. Spot blocks ensure uninterrupted run times for 1-6 hours at reduced costs.

The video emphasizes the importance of understanding EC2 pricing and billing for AWS exams.
